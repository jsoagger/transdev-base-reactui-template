# REACTJS + REDUX frontend integrated to a ready to deploy SPRINGBOOT backend


## Motivations


Starting a fullstack JAVA project from scratch is painfull, time consuming and very complex. You have to do same things again and again for each new project.

What about generating fullstack JAVA projects from template?

What about reusing components and capitalisation?

What about integration of frontend and backend?

What about deployment?
 
These are the reason why i have created this project template and the project TRANSDEV (transverse development).
Following technologies stack have been integrated:

* ReactJS + Redux + Router + more than 100 components
* SpringBoot 2.3
* JAVA 16
* Docker
* Maven 3.4

## Usage 

### Frontend UI only:

```
npx create-react-app your-project-name --template transdev-base-reactui-template
```


### Fullstack application
